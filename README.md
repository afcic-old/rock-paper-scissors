# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors

![Design preview for the Rock, Paper, Scissors coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This was another early project I did. I got help from Florin Pop and the tutorial he did on it, however I tried to do as much as I knew by myself. 

## WHAT I USED
On this project I used the basics HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Mainly because I believe it is good to first learn essentials before moving on to other frameworks.

## WHAT I LEARNED
The biggest challenge here was writing all the logic to how rock, paper and scissors react to each other and who wins. 

## WHERE TO FIND IT
I deployed the website with Github pages as always, feel free to check it out on : https://afcic.github.io/FrontEndMentor_RockPaperScissors/
